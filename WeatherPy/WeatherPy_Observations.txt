In part 1 of the python-api-challenge, WeatherPy, the following are observable trends based on the data.

1) There is a moderate correlation between maximum temperature and latitude based on the r-value. As we move closer to the equator, temperature rises.

2) Humidity and Cloudiness did not seem to share any correlation with latitude.

3) Location being in the Northern vs Southern Hemisphere did not change the correlations in any meaningful way.
