# python-api-challenge
What's the weather like as we approach the equator?

This project has a .gitignore which ignores the file: api_keys.py

If you want this to work for you, you will need to add your own api_keys.py that defines the following API keys:

 weather_api_key

 g_key

Where weather_api_key is the OpenWeatherMap API Key and g_key is the Google API key.
