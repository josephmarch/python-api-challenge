# python-api-challenge
A project to answer the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

This project has a .gitignore which ignores the file: api_keys.py. If you want the code in this project to work for you, you will need to add your own api_keys.py that defines the following API keys:

---weather_api_key

---g_key

Where weather_api_key is the OpenWeatherMap API key, and g_key is the Google API key.


Part 1 of the project is stored in the WeatherPy folder, though its output is stored in the output_data folder. The code for part 1 is WeatherPy.ipynb in the WeatherPy folder and the findings related to part 1 are listed in WeatherPy_Observations.txt in the WeatherPy folder. The cities.csv and png files relating to the plotted data are in the output_data folder.

Part 2 of the project is stored in the VacationPy folder. The code for part 2 is VacationPy.ipynb and a screenshot of the heatmap from the code is provided as VacationPyHeatmap.png.
